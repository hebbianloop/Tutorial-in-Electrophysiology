# Guided Tutorials in Electrophysiology
A set of guided mathematical tutorials in neuroelectrophysiology with simulations in Neuron, MATLAB and python.

## NEURON
Neuron is a software that allows simulation of biophysical and dynamical systems models of neural activity such the Nernst, Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz, Hodgkin-Huxley, Morris-Lecar models (and more!). Several tutorials have associated exercises using this software.

Please visit the [Neuron homepage](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download) and download the installer for your specific OS.

This project is still under active development.
